# Module 2 Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

I created a professional portfolio that showcases my skills and talents to potential employers. Having a portfolio with deployed applications will be typically very important for my career search after the boot camp. 

I applied the core skills I've recently learned about advanced CSS such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I used these skills to build a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Usage

 When you visit my portfolio, you will be presented with information about me, projects I've worked on (currently using placeholder images, names and links until I create more of my own), ways to contact me and my resume. You can click the links in the navigation bar to scroll to the corresponding section. 
 
 If you click on any of the projects in the work section,  you will be taken to that deployed application. You can also click on any of the links in the contact me section and it will re-direct you accordingly. 
 
 If you resize the screen or view it on a mobile device, you will be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your screen size.
